Rust is a low level programming language

Rust is a statically typed language
Rust is a compiled language
rust doesn't have garbage collector coz it makes the language slow so we will use ownership and we will manually do everything

so while doing manual management we have to deal with few errors like 
1. double free error
2. Null pointer deference in case of java
3. this makes rust fast and safe 
4. no manual memory management

data types --> uint , bool , string , array , tuple , enum , struct

we have to do memory management ourselves in rust 

strings are immutable by default
